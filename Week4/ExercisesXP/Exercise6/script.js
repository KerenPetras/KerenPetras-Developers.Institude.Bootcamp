// Exercise 6 : Bank Details
// Instructions
// In this exercise, you have to decide which type of variables you have to use (ie. let or const):

// Create a global variable called bankAmount which value is the amount of money currently in your account.
// Create a variable that saves the % amount of VAT (In Israel, itâ€™s 17%).
// Create an array with all your monthly expenses, both positive and negative (money made and money spent).
// Example : const details = ["+200", "-100", "+146", "+167", "-2900"]
// Create a program that modifies the expenses (ie. the positive AND the negative expenses) so that they will include taxes (multiply each expense by the VAT).
// Display your current bankAccount standing at the end of the month.

const bankAmount = 1000;
const vatPercentage = 0.17;
const details = ["+200", "-100", "+146", "+167", "-2900"];

let expenses = details.map((expense) => {
return expense[0] === "+"
? parseInt(expense) * (1 + vatPercentage)
: parseInt(expense) * (1 - vatPercentage);
});

let totalExpenses = expenses.reduce((total, expense) => total + expense, 0);
let bankAmountAtEndOfMonth = bankAmount + totalExpenses;

console.log("Bank amount at the end of the month: " + bankAmountAtEndOfMonth);
