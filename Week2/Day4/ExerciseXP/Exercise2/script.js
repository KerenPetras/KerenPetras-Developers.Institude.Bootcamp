function calculateTip() {
    const bill=+prompt("How much is the bill? ");
    if (bill > 200 ) {
        alert(` The tip for the bill is ${bill*0.10}, and together with the tip the bill is ${(bill*0.10)+bill} `);
    } else if (bill >= 50 && bill <= 200) {
        alert(` The tip for the bill is ${bill*0.15} , and together with the tip the bill is ${(bill*0.15)+bill} `)
    } else {alert(` The tip for the bill is ${bill*0.20} , and together with the tip the bill is ${(bill*0.20)+bill} `)}
}

calculateTip();
