// Exercise 1 : Evaluation
// Instructions
// For each expression, predict what you think the output will be in a comment (//) without first running the command.
// Of course, explain each prediction.
// Then run the expression in the console. Note the actual output in a comment and compare it with your prediction.

// Evaluate the comparisons found below:

// Look at this link for help

//     5 >= 1
//     0 === 1
//     4 <= 1
//     1 != 1
//     "A" > "B"
//     "B" < "C"
//     "a" > "A"
//     "b" < "A"
//     true === false
//     true != true

     5 >= 1 // number 5 is bigger and equal to number 1 (value)
     0 === 1 // triple equal means checks the type of the (value)
     4 <= 1 // number 4 is smaller and equal to number 1
     1 != 1 // number one is (!)NOT equal to number 1
     "A" > "B" // The Unicode value of "A" is 65 and the Unicode value of "B" is 66, so "B" is considered greater than "A" in the comparison. 
     "B" < "C" // The value of B is 66 however the value of C is 67
     "a" > "A" // the value of a is 97 and bigger than 65
     "b" < "A" // the value of 98 is bigger than 65 thats what the comparison is false;
     true === false // test value type
     true != true // true is NOT equal to true

     console.log("a" > "A");
